# Performing Subqueries 

### Step 1: Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers

SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country,
SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A 
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE C.city IN ('Aurora','Tokat','Tarsus','Atlixco','Emeishan','Pontianak', 'Shimoga','Aparecia de Goinia','Zalatun', 'Taguig')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5


### Step 2: Find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country.

SELECT DISTINCT (A.country), COUNT (DISTINCT D.customer_id) AS all_customers_count, COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) as count_top_customer
FROM country A
INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id = B.country_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country,
SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A 
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE C.city IN ('Aurora','Tokat','Tarsus','Atlixco','Emeishan','Pontianak', 'Shimoga','Aparecia de Goinia','Zalatun', 'Taguig')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers
ON A.country = top_5_customers.COUNTRY
GROUP BY A.country, top_5_customers
ORDER BY count_top_customer DESC
